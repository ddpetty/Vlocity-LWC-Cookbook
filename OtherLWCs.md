# Other LWCs

These are LWCs which do not live inside the context of Vlocity's platform (that is, not inside OmniScript or Cards), but nonetheless make use of the Vlocity Platform.





## Integration Procedures

[This LWC](OtherLWCs/ipLister.md) is a free standing LWC that is primarily intended to be place onto a record page.  It allows you to call a Vlocity Integration Procedure (VIP) and then display the results in tabular form. Its value, as an example, is to see how you can call VIPs from bespoke LWCs.
