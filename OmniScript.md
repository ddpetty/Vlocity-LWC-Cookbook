# OmniScript LWCs



## Buttons

### [Tiny Button](OmniScriptLWCs/TinyButton.md)

This LWC has a small UI foot print with a simple button and behaves somewhat like a set values.  It is intended mostly as a base to start building from, but gives you enough hooks to use as examples.

### [Flexi Button](OmniScriptLWCs/FlexiButton.md)

This LWC shows how you can pass in custom parameters that affect how the button is rendered.



## Data Display

### [OS Table](OmniScriptLWCs/OsTable.md)

Displays data in a tabular format in an OmniScript.

## Charting

### [OS Charting](OmniScriptLWCs/OsCharting.md)

This is a simple wrapper around ChartJS for inline charts in OmniScript.



## Publish and Subscribe

### [PubSub](OmniScriptLWCs/PubSub.md)

This is a simple demonstration of publish (click a button to publish the time) and subscribe (a label that updates with the published time).  It's simple, but demonstrates all of the mechanics involved.
