# Vlocity-LWC-Cookbook
This is a (hopefully) ever growing collection on useful idea for building Salesforce Lightning Web Components for use with Vlocity.

It is not an official product of Vlocity, is not supported by the company, but is as-is-where-is.

If you have questions or comments, you are welcome to send them along to me.

## Some Important Things to Note

1. These are a collection of samples, not production ready code.  And they may change, including in a breaking fashion.  Take a copy, modify it, and it's yours.
2. There is no support for these. Pull requests always welcome, however.
3. The namespace used in these examples may not be right for you.  Inspect both the .js and .js-meta.xml files to change the name space to the one that's appropriate for you.
